# Elliptic Curves Point Compressed Encoding

[Editors Draft](https://basileioskal.github.io/ec-point-serialization/draft-point-encoding.html)

[PoC Implementation](https://github.com/BasileiosKal/rs-point-serialization)

Compressed encoding for Weierstrass curve points. The encoding is a generalization of the ZCash based encoding defined for the BLS12-381 curves in [pairing friendly curves](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-11.html#name-zcash-serialization-format-).
